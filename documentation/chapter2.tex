\section{InvenTree}
InvenTree is an open-source Inventory Management System which tracks products from the supplier to the inventory. It provides low-level stock control and part tracking. The main focus of this application is inventory management in which it tracks the product from the manufacturer/supplier to the inventory by using QR codes to tag item locations. The major targets for this application are warehouses, retail stores etc.
In contrast to the above approach, our solution aims to monitor the inventory all allow end-users to purchase or rent items from the inventory i.e., we track the item from the inventory to the end-user. The major targets for our application are gated communities, education institutions etc.
