Once a super admin has logged in, they will see a grid of all the facilities available in the institute.

    \label{fig:facilities}
\end{figure}
Every facility has an info button, upon being hovered shows a brief description of the facility. (As shown in Library) 
When the user clicks on a facility, they will see all the categories or items in that facility. Clicking on a category recursively shows all the categories or items in it, similar to the image below.
